# Voron_Front_Door_Grips
Some nice Voron hexagonal style front door grips

These are some nice haxagonal Voron style front door grips. They are based on using M3 heat inserts and conical sunken bolts, so the mounting is almost not visible.
The drilling jig is designed for use in combination with the [Adjustable Ventilation Grille](https://github.com/tompany/Voron_adjustable_ventilation_grille), also in my repository (see pictures below).

## Below You'll find some pictures
